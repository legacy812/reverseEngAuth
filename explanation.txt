The setup starts with the server.js

We import express, express-session, and passport from installing npm.

We set the port equal to 8080 (which is routine) and bring in our db (models)

We create the middleware and app using express.

We connect our public folder and initialize passport.

We connect our routes and then connect our db with sequelize.


Config folder---
We have middleware for restricting routes a user is not allowed to visit if they are not logged in.

If they are logged in, they can view it.

In passport.js, we import passport and use the localhost. We create a function that requires a email and password. If the email is not in the database, it will return incorrect email.


MODELS FOLDER----
We create code for sequelize. We use bcrypt for password hashing. We use sequelize to create users and validate information.

In the public folder, we have our js, css, and html. Our JS will allow us to login and give functionality. The CSS and HTML is for design.


Lastly, our routes folder hooks it all together.
